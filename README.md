## Equip Framework

This is a fork of the [Equip Framework](https://github.com/equip/framework)

There haven't been any major functional changes, though [plates](https://platesphp.com/) support has been removed

The main changes have been making it compatible with PHP 8.0 by  upgrading all the dependencies,
moving to PSR-15 middleware and updating tests to PHPunit 9.0
